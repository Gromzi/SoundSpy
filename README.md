# SoundSet
**SoundSet** (I changed the name after creating the repo ;)) is a Shazam-inspired cross-platform application that predicts genres based on a recording or an uploaded file. It will be available on Android and web (and maybe iOS if I ever buy a MAC).
This repo is the frontend of the application, created with **Typescript** using **React Native** with **Expo**. I used the new **Expo Router** for routing, **React Hook Form** for handling forms and validation and **Zustand** for state management. The app also has a dark and light mode.

The app isn't deployed yet so if you want to test it out, you'd have to clone the repo, run `npm i` and `npm start`. After that you can run the web version. If you want to run the Android version, you'll need to scan the QR code in the console using the **Expo Go** app.
